/**
 * @brief Input handling functionallity is implemented in this namespace.
 *
 * usage:
 * For the input management to work at least one window needs to be open.
 *
 * Call update() once a frame. This is where all events from the window manager are handled including input events.
 * Then you can use polling functions to check for key states as well as get information on the cursor position and
 * the currently active window. Please note that window specific polling is implemented in the window class as well as
 * changing a windows input mode.
 * There are also functions to set the global cursor position as well as deal with the window managers clipboard content.
 * A number of custom calllback functions is also available. You can add multiple different callbacks of the same type if you need to.
 *
 * The heart of the input namespace is however managed input. This allows you to set input functions independent of hardware and later
 * create mappings to different devices. This way you can allow the end user to change the keys used to control the program.
 * Two types of inputs are available: button and axis. Button has a function that will be executed once the button is triggered, while
 * an axis has an additional value that represents the rate of change of an analog input.
 * However axis can also be mapped to digital keys as can buttons be mapped to analog inputs.
 * Currently keyboard, mouse button, scroll events and cursor movement are supported in mappings.
 * Use generateHelpString() to generate a string with all input functions and mappings for the users information.
 *
 * You can also add custom modifiers to an input mapping by passing a custom modifier name to the map function.
 * The custom modifier is created as its own input function. Use the name to map a key or button to it. This button
 * is required to be down for the other input mapping to be active. Mapping a analog input to a custom modifier will have no effect.
 *
 * Changing mappings and polling the state of input functions might be implemented in the future. Feel free to do so yourself if you need it now ;)
