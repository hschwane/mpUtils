# my todo list

## high priority
- fix incbin and windows compatibility
- add windows serial port

## medium priority

### license

### cmake
- https://cmake.org/pipermail/cmake/2017-December/066768.html
- split library, so that only necessary parts need to be linked or can be copied

### finish the input manager
- print used keys
- functions to change keys afterwards
- allow to trigger keys from the code
- some default / common used hotkeys
- maybe add a imgui window?

### resource manager
- allow to specify dependencies for "loadOne" method to handle bigger composite resources

### 3d rendering
- add some geometric primitives

### 2d renderer
- add a rendering animated sprites
- add 2d particle systems
- add 2d lighting and shadows
- add tilemaps
- add multisprites

### bugfix

## low priority / ideas / long term projects
- 2d collision detection and physics
- add double / triple buffering helper
- better + safer handling of uniforms for shaders
- add networking capabilities
- timer set for profiling apps
- jason and/or xml and easy serializing
- util for handling general settings
- tests
- profiling / visual profiling tools
- improvements to the log (lock-free-queue, more sinks with better format, different depths for messages)
- support for different ogl versions / have a manager to check for versions and extensions
- maybe add an openGL state / context wrapper?
- add texture compression and anisotropic filtering
- some spline support
- add text rendering
- add a proper 3d scene renderer
- more other graphics related features
- better floating point comparism modes
- add macros or constexpr functions for bit manipulation
